            <h2>Adopt and animal and listen to its heartbeat!</h2>
            <p>Help stop the extinction of animals. Your commitment makes a difference.
                You can "adopt" an animal at Anisave and give it better chances to live
                a good life in nature, as well as listen to its heartbeat though our app.
                We at Anisave hade developed a way to stream the heartbeat of a wild animal
                of your choosing directly to your phone via the use of satelites.</p>
                
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>

            <p>To save help save the wild animals, you create a user account on this
                page. Then, you choose the animal you want to "adopt" and Pay the
                donation. The money goes to improve the livelihood of the animal
                you have adopted. Once the transaction has been completed, you
                will be able to follow the animal in real time on your very own phone
                via our app, or directly on this page. This is only possible with
                Anisaves newly invented satellite technology. You will have the
                opportunity to follow where the animal is at all times with our
                interactive map. You will receive updates on what the money
                you have donated is used for, as well as how the condition is in
                the habitat where the animal lives. Our volunteer corps will then
                take pictures of the animal and send them to you if it is possible
                and we do not unnecessarily disturb the animals in any way. We have
                also used modern technology that can register the heartbeat of the
                animal you have adopted. This way you will feel close to the animal
                at all times and develop your very own bond to a wild animal.</p>

            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>

            <p class="end">Earth's wildlife is disappearing at a furious pace. In a cynical
                world, where the animals' livelihoods are at the expense of
                economic profit, mass extinction of endangered species is imminent.
                Anisave is the animals' advocate. Together we can prevent the
                degradation of the natural areas where the animals live and
                facilitate the best possible living conditions for these animals.
                Because we believe that the animals of todays age should live on
                for their and our next generations sake, and with your help we can
                make that dream a reality.</p>
